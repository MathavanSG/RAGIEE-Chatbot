# ðŸ¤– RAGIEE-Chatbot: Academic PDF Assistant

**RAGIEE-Chatbot** is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload research papers (PDFs), visualize them, ask questions, and receive intelligent, LLM-powered responses. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and dynamically highlights matched chunks inside the original PDF document using `streamlit-pdf-viewer`.

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ“„ PDF Upload + Viewer
- Upload any academic paper in PDF format

  - `chunk_embedding`: Full content of each section
  - `section_embedding`: Semantic meaning of section headings
- Hybrid retrieval logic:
  1. Tries to match semantically with section headings first
